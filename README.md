# Stock Price Predictor App

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Stock Price Predictor App, where the synergy of machine learning and real-time data delivers captivating insights into stock market trends. Explore its innovative features for dynamic and interactive predictions of stock prices.
Here's a closer look at what the app offers:

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the app offers a seamless and interactive user experience, allowing users to input their desired stock symbols and view predictions.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, enabling users to visualize past performance.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Utilizes a pre-trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict future stock prices.
- **Visual Insights**: Provides detailed plots comparing original and predicted stock prices, along with future price projections.

## How It Works

1. **Input Stock Symbol**: Users can enter any stock symbol (default is Bitcoin - BTC-USD).
2. **Data Fetching**: The app retrieves historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, dating back ten years.
3. **Model Prediction**: Using the LSTM model, the app predicts future stock prices based on historical data.
4. **Visualization**: The app generates various plots to visualize historical, predicted, and future stock prices.

## Technical Details

- **Streamlit**: An open-source app framework for creating and sharing custom web apps for machine learning and data science.
- **Keras**: A powerful deep learning library used for training the LSTM model.
- **Yahoo Finance API**: Provides reliable and up-to-date stock market data.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used to create static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

## Visualizations

- **Historical Data**: Displays the historical closing prices of the selected stock.
- **Predicted vs. Actual Prices**: Compares the model's predictions with actual stock prices to assess accuracy.
- **Future Price Predictions**: Projects future stock prices based on the model's predictions.

## Future Enhancements

- **Model Improvements**: Continuously refine the model for better accuracy and performance.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback to improve the app's functionality and usability.
